# Nette 2 & Doctrine MongoDB ODM entities

Nette addon for using Doctrine MongoDB ODM entities directly as Nette identity


Motivation
------

If you are using Nette 2 and Doctrine MongoDB ODM together, you will sooner or later
want to use some of your entities also as identity, because it is practical.

Fortunately, this addon is here to help you with this task!

This is fork of Majkl578/nette-identity-doctrine.


Requirements
------

- PHP 5.3.2 or newer
- Nette 2.0 or newer
- Doctrine ORM 2.3 or newer

Current status
---------------

I developed this extension during one project and it worked well. Since I'm not currently using it, this extension may not work with newer nette or doctrine. If you find any errors, feel free to open issue and/or submit pull request.
